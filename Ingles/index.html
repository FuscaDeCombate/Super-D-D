        <h1 class="title">Dungeons and Dragons</h1>
        <p>Dungeons & Dragons is a high fantasy role-playing game where players create
            characters who embark on imaginary adventures in which they face monsters, gather treasure,
            interact with each other and gain experience points to become incredibly powerful as they
            the game progresses. The game's extensive rules, which cover areas
            such as social interactions, use of magic, combat and the effect of the environment on the characters, help the
            master in your decisions. The DM can choose which published rules he will use and even create
            new rules if necessary.</p>

                <p>D&D Player's Handbook is the essential book for anyone starting out in the world of Dungeons &
                    Dragons. It is the main reference for every participant at a Dungeons & Dragons table. O
                    book contains the rules for creating characters, backgrounds and skills, in addition to the rules
                    for leveling up, exploration, combat and more. Use this guide to create characters from the races
                    and most iconic D&D classes.

        <p>Among these books, many are ready-made adventures, the focus is on the text. Ready-made adventures are adventures,
            stories or scenarios ready to be used and that require little work for the master; since you already have the
            story, hook, characters, etc.
            This way the GM doesn't need to create the story from scratch, but still needs to manage the world, if
            adapt the players' decisions and, of course, make the 'scenes' flow. Think of ready-made adventures as
            topics of a slide presentation, where the master will have to take these topics, develop them and create
            nexus between them.</p>
